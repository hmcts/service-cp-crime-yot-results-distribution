/**
 * A request that keeps failing is retried, parked visibly after exactly five deliveries, and then
 * reprocessed to completion from one resubmission.
 *
 * <p>Three separate facts are asserted, because the story is only useful if all three hold:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Every failed delivery is recorded</strong> — RETRYING, the bounded failure reason,
 *       and the cumulative attempt count. Support can see a request struggling before it is
 *       parked.</li>
 *   <li><strong>The fifth delivery parks it</strong> — FAILED with the identity of the delivery that
 *       exhausted the budget, and the message on the dead-letter queue carrying this service's own
 *       reason. Exactly five deliveries: parking on the fourth loses a retry the queue was willing
 *       to give, and letting the broker park it on the sixth means the record never says FAILED at
 *       all and no dead-letter reason of ours ever reaches the queue.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A resubmission replays it</strong> — under a fresh message identity, attempts
 *       preserved rather than reset, ending COMPLETED with six cumulative attempts.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The state each run saw when it started is captured from the payload port rather than polled: a
 * poller racing broker redelivery would read whichever state it happened to catch, and the
 * intermediate RETRYING rows would be asserted only by luck. Reading the row at the point the run
 * begins is deterministic — the single-runner claim guarantees the runs are sequential — and it is
 * the honest question anyway: what did the processed log say when this attempt started?
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the port is a test double.</strong> The stub's failure switch is a configuration
 * property read once at construction (it is deliberately not a field in the message and not an HTTP
 * endpoint), and this scenario needs the fault repaired <em>between</em> the parking and the replay,
 * inside one running service. The double is still test-controlled configuration of the adapter — the
 * property's purpose, with the timing the scenario requires — and it is scoped to this suite's own
 * request: a neighbouring suite's message travelling the shared queue is handed the placeholder and
 * passes through untouched.
