/**
 * Spec SC-106: a reviewer with a request id and nothing else can follow the request from receipt to
 * settlement.
 *
 * <p>"And nothing else" is the requirement. No database, no broker tooling, no correlation with
 * timestamps across three components — one identifier, typed into a log search, and the whole life of
 * the request comes back in order. That is what the support conversation about a missing register
 * actually looks like, and it is the reason correlation is put in place before the first line about a
 * delivery is written and taken down after the last.
 *
 * <p>The happy path is asserted first, then the path that matters more: a request that fails, is
 * retried, and is finally parked. A trace that only holds while nothing goes wrong is no trace at all
 * — the request a reviewer looks up is, by definition, one that did not behave.
 *
 * <p>The suite reads its evidence through the MDC rather than by matching the identifier inside
 * message text. The MDC is what the JSON encoder puts on every line and therefore what a log index
 * makes searchable; a suite that matched substrings would pass on lines a reviewer could never find.
 *
 * <p>Nothing in either trace carries a defendant, a court centre or a word of anybody else's — that
 * is {@code TelemetryPrivacyTest}'s subject, and it holds every line this suite reads. What is
 * asserted here is that the bounded, correlated lines that remain are enough to tell the story.
 *
 * <p>An acceptance suite over assembled behaviour: it may legitimately pass on introduction, and its
 * first observed result is recorded rather than a red run.
