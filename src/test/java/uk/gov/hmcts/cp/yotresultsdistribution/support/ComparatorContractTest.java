/**
 * Pins the golden-file comparator against an adversarial vector pack.
 *
 * <p>The golden-parity suite is only worth the disk it sits on if the comparator underneath it is
 * lenient in exactly the dimensions the contract relaxes and strict everywhere else. A comparator
 * that is lenient in the WRONG dimension — one that sorts arrays, say — reports PASS for every
 * golden file while the ported pipeline reorders defendants, and the entire suite silently stops
 * being evidence of anything. This class is the test that the tests are real.
 *
 * <p>The contract being pinned, from the service's technical rules on testing conventions and the
 * constitution's Principle I:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>field-order-<strong>in</strong>sensitive</li>
 *   <li>array-order-<strong>sensitive</strong></li>
 *   <li>BigDecimal-tolerant (scale-insensitive, <em>not</em> approximate)</li>
 *   <li>{@code NON_EXTENSIBLE} — an unexpected field is a difference</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>All 57 vectors are decided.</strong> Eight were once marked {@code UNSPECIFIED} —
 * five presence pairs, two Unicode normalisation pairs and the IEEE-754 artefact — and all eight
 * are now {@code DIFFERENT}, each with its derivation recorded in its {@code rationale}. They were
 * not decided by preference: the contract's baseline outside its three enumerated relaxations is
 * exact structural and value equality, {@code NON_EXTENSIBLE} makes any field-set mismatch a
 * difference, and no rule licenses a presence, normalisation or epsilon relaxation. Leaving them
 * undecided while deriving every {@code type/} vector from that same principle was an
 * inconsistency, not caution.
 *
 * <p>What genuinely stays open is a different question and lives in {@code README.md}: what to DO
 * when the port and a legacy golden disagree on one of those points — a registered defect fix in
 * {@code doc/DEFECT-FIXES.md}, not a widened comparator.
 *
 * <p>The {@code UNSPECIFIED} mechanism remains. A vector added later whose verdict the contract
 * does not determine is reported as skipped, carrying the decision that has to be taken, rather
 * than asserted in either direction — encoding a guess would quietly turn one team member's
 * opinion into the parity contract. Recording a decision means editing that vector's verdict to
 * {@code EQUAL} or {@code DIFFERENT}; the test then starts enforcing it with no change to this
 * file.
 *
 * <p><strong>Provenance.</strong> This class, {@link JsonParity} and the vector pack are vendored
 * from {@code service-cp-crime-informant-register}, where they were written and where the 57
 * vectors were decided. Nothing in any of them touches a domain type, which is why they can be
 * taken whole: the comparison contract is a property of the parity harness, not of what is being
 * compared, and re-deriving it here would produce a second opinion where there should be one.
