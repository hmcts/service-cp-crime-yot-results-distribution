/**
 * One case per row of the data model's transition table, plus the guard decisions that are not
 * transitions, driven through the guard against a real processed log.
 *
 * <p>The table is the contract this suite exists to hold: every branch is asserted on both of the
 * things it produces — the decision the delivery is handed, and the row the database is left
 * holding. A branch that returned the right decision while writing the wrong row would be a
 * duplicate register in production and a green build here, so neither half is taken on trust.
 *
 * <p>The completion half of the table is this flow's own. A court-register run ends well in
 * <strong>five</strong> ways, four of which send nothing at all, and two of those four are the
 * commonest results the service has: a court centre nobody subscribes to, and a hearing with no
 * youth defendants. Folding them into an undifferentiated success is the legacy defect C33, so each
 * of the five is driven through the guard and read back from the column support queries.
 *
 * <p>Each test mints its own request, so the cases share the container without sharing state.
