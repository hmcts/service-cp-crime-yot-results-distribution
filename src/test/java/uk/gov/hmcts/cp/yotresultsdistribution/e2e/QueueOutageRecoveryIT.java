/**
 * The broker goes away and comes back, and the pod neither restarts nor stays broken.
 *
 * <p>Two halves, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong. Reporting the outage is
 * straightforward; <strong>recovering from it without help</strong> is not. A client left on a long
 * default back-off will eventually reconnect, but "eventually" is not a service level: the budget is
 * sixty seconds from the queue returning, which is why the retry options are configured explicitly
 * rather than inherited.
 *
 * <p><strong>The outage is staged with work in hand, deliberately and not incidentally.</strong> The
 * SDK reports nothing at all about a broker that has gone away while the consumer is idle: it treats
 * a lost connection as retryable and rolls its message pump silently, and five minutes against a
 * broker that had been stopped outright produced no callback of any kind. The signal the health
 * component is built on is a round trip that failed, so there has to be one — which is also the case
 * that matters operationally, because an outage while there is nothing to do costs nothing.
 *
 * <p>The transport is cut through Toxiproxy rather than by doing something violent to a container,
 * which turns the scenario from a race into a sequence: a delivery is held open, the transport is
 * cut underneath it, and only then is it allowed to finish. Its settlement is refused immediately —
 * with the container merely stopped it would have blocked instead, because the client retries a
 * connection it cannot make — so the suite controls the ordering rather than betting on it.
 *
 * <p>The gauge is asserted alongside the health component because they answer the same question to
 * two different audiences — a probe and a dashboard — and a pair that can disagree is worse than
 * either alone.
