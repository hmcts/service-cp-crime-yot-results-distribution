/**
 * The outage that outlasts the delivery budget.
 *
 * <p>This is the case suspension exists for. A service that kept consuming through a store outage
 * would abandon each delivery and get it straight back; five of those round trips cost seconds, and
 * at the end of them the broker parks a message whose only fault was arriving at a bad moment. The
 * work is then on the dead-letter queue, where somebody has to notice it and resubmit it — for an
 * outage that fixed itself.
 *
 * <p>"More than five nominal retry intervals" is measured the way the damage would happen: the
 * outage is held open far longer than five abandon-and-redeliver cycles take against this broker,
 * and the assertion is that the message's delivery count did not move. A suspended consumer takes no
 * deliveries at all, so the budget is not merely unspent — it is untouched, and the message is still
 * on the queue rather than beside it.
 *
 * <p>The suite starts its own service and closes it, so the delivery count it reads is a fact about
 * this consumer and not about whichever other suite's context happened to be cached.
