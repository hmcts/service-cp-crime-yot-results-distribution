/**
 * The validated form of an inbound queue message.
 *
 * <p>A typed record rather than a JSON tree because this is the service's own closed contract, not a
 * foreign payload: the fields are agreed jointly with the publishing context and the schema is
 * {@code additionalProperties: false}. Inbound hearing payloads — which this service does not own —
 * stay canonical trees; see the constitution's Principle IV.
 *
 * <p><strong>Six of the seven are required; {@code userId} is not.</strong> It names the user whose
 * share of the results produced this message, and every downstream call of the run is attributed to
 * them — which is what the function app does with the envelope's {@code userId}
 * ({@code CourtRegisterEventGridTrigger/index.js:16}, {@code CourtRegisterQueueTrigger/index.js:17}
 * → {@code cjscppuid}). It is optional because two legitimate producers have no user to name:
 * support replay tooling, where the replay is built by hand rather than re-sent verbatim or is
 * re-sent deliberately without the field because the original user has been deactivated, and any
 * producer build from before the field existed. Those messages run under the configured system
 * identity instead, which is why the absence is modelled as an empty {@link Optional} rather than as
 * a defect.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code hearingDay} keeps its wire name.</strong> The legacy trigger renames it to
 * {@code hearingDate} on its way into the orchestration, which collides with two other dates this
 * flow carries: the register's hearing date, derived from the latest {@code judicialResult
 * .orderedDate}, and the register date, derived from {@code sharedTime}. The three are distinct and
 * must not be conflated (design doc §2.2). Here {@code hearingDay} keys the Redis claim-check and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Every component is normalised at parse time, so an uppercase-hex identifier and an
 * offset-bearing instant arrive here in the same canonical shape as their lowercase and {@code Z}
 * equivalents.
 *
 * <p>Canonical schema: {@code src/main/resources/contracts/distribution-command.schema.json}.
 *
 * @param source      publishing system; namespaces {@code requestId} in the idempotency key
 * @param requestId   publisher-minted, deterministic from the hearing, day and shared time
 * @param hearingId   the resulted hearing
 * @param hearingDay  the hearing day this share relates to; the claim-check key and nothing else
 * @param sharedTime  the instant at which the hearing was shared, normalised to UTC
 * @param eventType   the publishing event; {@code Hearing_Resulted} only
 * @param userId      the user who shared the results, where the message named one; empty for a
 *                    transition-window message, or a replay that does not carry the original body,
 *                    both of which run under the system identity
