/**
 * The two things a delivery needs to know about the processed log before it is examined.
 *
 * <p>Store availability is a <strong>precondition</strong> rather than a step: a delivery arriving
 * without a store is handed straight back, unexamined, and intake stops until the store returns.
 * Both halves are here because both belong to the same moment — the callback that discovers the
 * outage is the callback that has to give its delivery back and ask for intake to stop.
 *
 * <p>Asking is all the callback may do. Stopping a processor from inside its own message callback
 * deadlocks the shutdown, because the shutdown waits for that very callback to return, so the
 * request is enqueued and carried out somewhere else.
