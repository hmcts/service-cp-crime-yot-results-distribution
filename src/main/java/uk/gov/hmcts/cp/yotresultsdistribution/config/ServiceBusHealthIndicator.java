/**
 * Whether the broker is reachable — reported loudly, and never allowed to gate readiness.
 *
 * <p>Registered <strong>outside</strong> the readiness group on purpose (spec FR-011). A pod cannot
 * heal a broker by restarting, so a broker in readiness turns a blip into a rolling restart of every
 * consumer at once — while the queue, which was the only thing actually wrong, stays exactly as
 * wrong as it was. The state still has to be visible, so it is its own health component and its own
 * gauge.
 *
 * <p><strong>The signal.</strong> Nothing here polls the broker: a health check that sent a probe
 * message would cost a delivery every time it ran and would race the support tooling that drains the
 * queue. It reads what the SDK already reports — the {@code processError} callback, the fact that a
 * delivery arrived, and the fate of a settlement — and answers from the relationship between them:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a <strong>connection-class</strong> failure with nothing since means the queue is
 *       unreachable. A message-level failure — a lock lost, a message not found — does not: those
 *       arrive over a connection that plainly worked;</li>
 *   <li>traffic <strong>after</strong> the failure is the answer to the failure. A receive that
 *       succeeded says more about reachability than an error that preceded it;</li>
 *   <li>and a failure older than {@code yotresultsdistribution.servicebus.health-staleness} with nothing
 *       since is <strong>not</strong> an outage <em>for a consumer the broker has answered
 *       before</em>. An idle queue produces no traffic, so "no traffic since the error" is the
 *       normal state of a healthy service at four in the morning, and a component that reported
 *       DOWN for it would be reporting the working day rather than the broker.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The gauge is set from the same evaluation, so a dashboard and a probe can never disagree about
 * what this component thinks.
 *
 * <p>Details carry a bounded condition name and two timestamps. Never the exception's own text:
 * these are transport faults whose messages carry namespaces, entity paths and, on an
 * authentication failure, whatever the credential layer felt like quoting.
