/**
 * One delivery in, exactly one settlement out.
 *
 * <p>The transport adapter. It reads the body, hands the request to the core, and performs the one
 * settlement the core's decision names — nothing more. The structure is what guarantees the "exactly
 * one" half: every path produces a {@link GuardDecision}, and settlement happens once, afterwards,
 * in one place. There is no route through this class that reaches the end without a settlement
 * attempt and none that settles twice, which is what stops a delivery being left to time out (spec
 * FR-001, constitution Principle VI). A lock that has expired is discovered from the broker's own
 * refusal of that one attempt — never from a local clock reading — and is then reported and counted
 * under its own instrument, with the broker's redelivery as the recovery (spec FR-016).
 *
 * <p>Ordering is the other half. A delivery is acknowledged only after the outcome write has
 * returned durably, because a message acknowledged before the write is a request the processed log
 * has never heard of and the broker will never deliver again.
 *
 * <p>One broker fact is read here and nowhere else: whether the queue will deliver this message
 * again. The processed log cannot answer it — the delivery budget belongs to the message, not to the
 * request — so the transport adapter reads it from the delivery and carries it into the core, where
 * it decides whether a failing run is recorded as retrying or parked.
 *
 * <p>Correlation is put in place as soon as the body yields it and taken down when the delivery
 * ends, so receipt, processing and settlement all carry the same {@code requestId}, {@code hearingId}
 * and {@code hearingDay} — and nothing beyond that set, because every defendant on a court register
 * is a youth and the correlation identifiers are the whole of what a log index may be told
 * (constitution Principle VII). The pod handles one delivery per callback thread, and the
 * {@code finally} is what keeps one delivery's identifiers off the next one's lines.

     * settlement", add a reading to the settlement-failure series that never happened, and leave a
     * message that <em>is</em> parked looking unparked — while the real fault disappeared behind
     * somebody else's name. Such a failure is therefore allowed to propagate: the delivery is already
     * settled, so nothing is at risk, and the processor's error handler reports it as what it is
     * rather than this method reporting it as what it is not (constitution Principle VI — surfaced,
     * never swallowed).
     *
     * <p>A refusal by the broker is reported and counted, and that is all. It is deliberately
     * <strong>not</strong> followed by a settlement of another kind: handing a delivery back because
     * acknowledging it failed would either double-settle a lock this service still holds, or
     * succeed — turning work that <em>is</em> durably recorded into a redelivery that runs again. The
     * outcome was written before the settlement was attempted, so the redelivery meets a record that
     * already knows the answer: a completed request is acknowledged without a run, and a parked one
     * is parked again (spec FR-016, FR-007).
