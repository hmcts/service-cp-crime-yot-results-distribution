/**
 * Takes the migration off the context-refresh path — and does nothing else.
 *
 * <p>By default Flyway migrates while the context is refreshing, which means a pod cannot start
 * without its database. That is the wrong trade for this service: the one thing a pod must be able
 * to do when the store is down is <strong>start and say so</strong>. A context that refuses to
 * refresh cannot serve a readiness endpoint, so it cannot report DOWN, so all anybody sees is a
 * crash loop with the reason buried in the logs of a container that no longer exists. Retry settings
 * only postpone that.
 *
 * <p>So the Flyway bean is still configured — {@code spring.flyway.enabled} stays true, the
 * migrations are still validated and still run — but <em>when</em> they run becomes a decision the
 * consumer lifecycle controller makes: on the first successful store probe, before the processor is
 * started. That ordering is the point. Migration success is part of the probe-gated start, so there
 * is no window in which a message could be consumed against a schema that does not exist yet.
 *
 * <p>This strategy is therefore deliberately, loudly empty. It is not a way of skipping migrations;
 * it is a way of moving them somewhere a failure can be reported.
