/**
 * Has this pod actually started working yet?
 *
 * <p>A readiness group containing only the store's own contributor answers a narrower question than
 * readiness is asked: it says the database replies, not that this service is in a position to use
 * it. Between those two there is a whole start-up — the deferred migration, and then the processor —
 * and both can fail. A pod whose migration is throwing reports the database UP, is therefore ready,
 * is sent traffic by the platform, counts as a healthy replica in a rolling deployment, and consumes
 * nothing at all. The deployment completes; the queue quietly grows.
 *
 * <p>So the gated start reports on itself. It stays DOWN until the migration has run and the
 * processor has been started, and thereafter says nothing: a later store outage is the store's
 * contributor to report, and intake suspension is not an unreadiness — the pod is working correctly
 * and waiting, and rolling it would help nobody.
 *
 * <p>Where no consumer is configured at all there is no start to wait for, and the answer is UP.
 * That is not a loophole: a service with intake switched off has nothing to be unready about, and
 * failing the group's membership check instead would be an obscure way to say so.
