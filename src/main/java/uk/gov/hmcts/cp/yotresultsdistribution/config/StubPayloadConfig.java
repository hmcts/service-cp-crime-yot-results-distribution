/**
 * The payload source that fetches nothing, kept for local runs and for the suites that do not need
 * one.
 *
 * <p>The container suites whose subject is settlement, the processed log and health have no interest
 * in a hearing payload, and standing a cache and an HTTP stub up for them would make what they prove
 * depend on infrastructure their scenarios never mention. They select this instead.
 *
 * <p>Never the default, and not selectable where the service is deployed. It contributes a bean only
 * when {@code yotresultsdistribution.payload.mode} says {@code STUB}, so an environment that says nothing
 * gets the real adapter — and {@link PropertiesValidator} refuses {@code STUB} outright wherever the
 * deployed credential source is in use, because a stub reachable in production is exactly the pod
 * that settles every message and produces no register (constitution Principle V).
