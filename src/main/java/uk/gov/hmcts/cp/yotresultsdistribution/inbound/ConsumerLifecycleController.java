/**
 * The only thing permitted to start or stop the consumer.
 *
 * <p>Intake is a decision, not a side effect. Left to itself the processor would start with the
 * context and consume whatever the queue had, whether or not this pod could record what it did —
 * and a store outage would then be spent one delivery at a time, five deliveries per message, until
 * the broker parked work that was never faulty. Putting every start and stop behind one component
 * is what makes "do not consume without a store" expressible at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three states, and the third is the one people forget.</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code AWAITING_STORE} — the state every pod begins in. The context has refreshed and
 *       actuator is up, so readiness can report DOWN honestly, but nothing is being consumed and
 *       the schema has not been migrated yet.</li>
 *   <li>{@code RUNNING} — the store answered, the migration ran, the processor is consuming.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SUSPENDING} — the store went away and the processor has been asked to stop but has
 *       not yet stopped. Ordinarily a moment long; it lasts only while a {@code stop()} is
 *       refusing, and it is what keeps the next delivery's request from meeting a no-op.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SUSPENDED} — the store went away while we were running. Intake stopped; the probe
 *       keeps asking; the moment the store answers again we are back in {@code RUNNING}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code STOPPING} and {@code STOPPED} — the context is closing. Terminal: nothing starts
 *       intake from here, however far through a start it already was.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code AWAITING_STORE} is distinct from {@code SUSPENDED} on purpose. Both consume nothing, but
 * only one of them is an incident: a pod that has not started consuming yet is a pod starting up,
 * and counting that as a suspension would put an incident on the dashboard at every deployment.
 * The gauge and the counter therefore describe the outage cycle — {@code RUNNING → SUSPENDED →
 * RUNNING} — and say nothing about the gated start, which readiness already describes.
 *
 * <p><strong>Migration happens here, before the first message.</strong> A no-op
 * {@code FlywayMigrationStrategy} keeps it off the context-refresh path so a pod can start without
 * its database; this controller runs it on the first successful probe, <em>before</em> the
 * processor is started. There is no ordering in which a delivery meets an unmigrated schema.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing transitions on a callback thread.</strong> Every start, stop and migration runs
 * on one single-threaded scheduled executor, which is also what runs the probe. That gives three
 * properties at once: transitions are serialised, so a resume cannot race a suspension; they are
 * idempotent, because each one checks the state it is transitioning from; and {@code stop()} is
 * never called from inside a message callback, which would deadlock — the shutdown waits for the
 * callbacks to drain, and one of them would be the caller.
 *
 * <p><strong>Single replica.</strong> Suspension is a per-pod decision, so with several replicas a
 * store outage could still burn deliveries on pods that had not yet noticed. Cluster-safe suspension
 * belongs to the KEDA/scale-out story; the constraint is recorded in the plan.
