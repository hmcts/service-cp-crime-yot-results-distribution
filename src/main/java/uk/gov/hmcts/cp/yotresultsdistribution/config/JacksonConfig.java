 * and the deserialisation feature that keeps monetary values exact is
 * {@link DeserializationFeature#USE_BIG_DECIMAL_FOR_FLOATS} — the constant name is unchanged from
 * Jackson 2, only the package moved.
 *
 * <p>The feature is applied in two places for one reason: {@link #applyContractDefaults} is the
 * single definition, and both the application's auto-configured mapper (through the customizer bean
 * below) and the standalone mapper unit tests build (through {@link #contractObjectMapper()}) are
 * built by it. Configuring only the standalone factory would have left the running service reading
 * money as binary floating point while the unit tests stayed green.
