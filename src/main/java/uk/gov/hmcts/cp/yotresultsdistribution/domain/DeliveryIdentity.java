 * Who is delivering, and under which broker identity.

 * <p>The two travel together because the guard needs both and they are both strings: the message
 * identity decides the FAILED branch (a replay under a fresh identity, or a redelivery of the one
 * that exhausted the retries), and the claim owner is stamped on the row for the run's lifetime.
 * Passing them as one value is what stops them being passed the wrong way round.
 *
 * <p>Whether this is the last delivery the queue permits travels with them, because it is the third
 * fact about the delivery rather than about the request: the record cannot tell you it, and the run
 * that fails has to know it before it writes its outcome. A failure with deliveries remaining is
 * recorded RETRYING and handed back; the same failure on the final permitted delivery is recorded
 * FAILED and parked, in the transaction that stamps the identity above onto the row.
 *
